The question asked lot of time to lot of people. Each has some reasons for immutability of java strings.<br />
<br />
Java has primitive types which are inherently immutable.<br />
<br />
int i = 0;<br />
void changeValue(int val) {<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; val = 1;<br />
}<br />
changeValue(i);<br />
<br />
Value of "i" is still 0.<br />
<br />
The same way strings are just sequence of character. It should be primitive as well. It brings peace of mind with it.<br />
<br />
As primitive has&nbsp;+ and - operations strings also have concatenation and substring operations. String is not primitive so java has workaround for it and made it feels like primitive.<br />
<br />
All this lead us to immutable string object.<br />
<br />
The same rules applied to other java objects like. All wrapper classes (Integer, Float etc.), BigDecimal, BigInteger, Color etc.&nbsp;</div>
